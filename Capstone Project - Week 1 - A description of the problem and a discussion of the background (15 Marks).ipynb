    "hence he has access to good public transportation to work. \n",

    "such as international restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. \n",
    "He has been offered a great opportunity to work in Manhattan, NY. \n",
    "He actully is very excited about it, but he is a bit stressed toward the process to secure a comparable place to live in Manhattan. \n",
    "Therefore, I have decided to apply the skills I learned during the Coursera course to explore ways to help him in making sure \n",
    "that his decision is factual and rewarding. Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available several other tools, but it is worth and complimentary doing it with all the tools I laearned with Coursera.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hense - in order to set a basis for comparison, I want to find a rental unit subject to the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apartment with min 2 bedrooms with monthly rent not to exceed US$7000/month\n",
    "- Unit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Manhattan\n",
    "- Area with amenities and venues similar to the ones described for current location ( See item 2.1)\n",

    "1.3 The intended Audience for this Project\n",
    "I believe this is a relevant project for any person or entity considering to move to a major city in Europe, US or Asia, \n",
    "since the approach and methodologies used here are applicable in all cases. \n",
    "The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will definitely help to resolve all the \n",
